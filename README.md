Submissions to my CSC 131 class.

### Chars
Take in a user inputted string ended by a period.
Count and output the number occurrance of each letter in the string.

### Circle
Take the radius of a circle inscribed in a square.

Output the circle's diameter, circumference, and area and the square's
perimeter and area, as well as the difference between the two shapes'
areas.

### Collections
Ask the user to enter information about three book collections. Each
collection has a number of volumes and a price per volume (same for
each volume in the collection).

Ask how many volumes and what is the price per volume for each
collection, as well as a budget available for a buyer named Bob.

Output what Bob can afford.

### Conditions
Ask the user for 4 integers, w, x, y, and z.

Evaluate and output if x is smallest, if w + x <= y + z, and if all for
integers are even or not.

### Convert
Standard: Read an integer entered by the user and display it in binary.
Extended: Read an integer and a base and convert to that base.

### Counters
Ask the user to enter a sentence ended by a period, a question mark, or
an exclamation mark and print out the number of space characters
(spaces, new lines, tabs) in that sentence.

### Functions
Take user input for a cell phone plan.

User enters the number of lines on the customer's account, and the
number of minutes and texts and gigabytes of data used across the whole
account.

### IO
Take the length, width, and height of a rectangular prism and calculate
the surface area and volume of the prism.  Output the area and volume.

### Iterations

### Operators

### Pointers

### Strings
Custom implementations of strlen, strcmp, strcat, and strcpy!
